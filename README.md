resh
===========

A command line shell for reading reddit.com. 80 karmalicious columns of reddit goodness.

resh is:

* _Cross-platform_ : Works in any modern operating system, and also on Windows.
* _Mouse-less_ : Browse reddit without taking your hands off the keyboard.
* _Boss-proof_ : Because as long as it's on a terminal, you can pass it off as work.
* _Matrix like_ : You will no longer see the code, just 'cat', 'meme', 'bacon'.
* _Free_ : Free as in freedom, free as in beer, and free as in Willy.
* _Not finished yet_ : But it's getting there


Dependencies
